    <h1>Case Study</h1>
    <h1>Overview</h1>
    <p>The goal for this project was to create a recipe website using PHP as the main coding language. PHP is a language that I have never used before. 
        We also had to work with a database to create a site that could be changed by the user
    </p>
    <h1>Context and Challenge</h1>
    <p>This project was a class assignment for a scripting class. It was designed to show that I learned the basics of using PHP as a coding language. </p>
    <h1>Process and Insight</h1>
    <p>The start of this project was creating an initial design idea to build the website around. Building the HTML portion of the site went well for me and I was able to 
        create something that looked nice. When it came time to work with PHP I struggled a lot. I understood how everything was supposed to work, but it was so incredibly frustrating to be unable to get the project to work fully. I was also scared to ask for help because I had taken the course once before.
        However, I finally got out of my shell a bit and was able to reach out to my fellow students
    </p>
    <h1>Results</h1>
    <p class="bottom">Ultimatly I was unsuccessful with completing this project. Try as I might, I was not able to get the site to function fully and input all of the recipies. Despite that, I am happy to have come so far with learning how to code using php. Last year I honestly didnt even attempt to do this project so even what I was able to do was satisfying.
         In the future I know that I wish I had been able to get the site to work as it was an interesting assignment and I am ultimatly frustrated with myself for being unable to succeed with it. </p>
